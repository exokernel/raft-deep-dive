# A Deep Dive Into the Raft Consensus Algorithm

This book provides an in-depth exploration of the Raft consensus algorithm, covering its design, implementation, and use cases.

Currently a work in progress.

## Building the Book

The book is built automatically using a GitHub workflow that runs the `mdbook` tool. The workflow is triggered by pushes to the `main` branch, and the resulting book is published to GitHub Pages.
