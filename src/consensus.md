# Consensus

Consensus is the process by which a network of nodes in a distributed system agree on a single data value. In the context of raft and other consensus algorithms, this data value is typically a log of commands that are to be executed by the nodes in the system. The goal of consensus is to ensure that all nodes in the system agree on the same log of commands, even in the presence of failures.

## The Main Components of Raft

### Leader Election

### Log Replication

### Persistence
