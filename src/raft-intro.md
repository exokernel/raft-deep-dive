# Raft Intro

The raft consensus algorithm is designed to be easy to understand. It's equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. The difference is that it's decomposed into relatively independent subproblems, and it cleanly addresses all major pieces needed for practical systems. This means it's easier to understand, easier to implement, and easier to reason about.
